# Resources

AWS is extensive and can be very complex if you really dive into it. This class really only serves as an introduction, but if you enjoy it then I would recommend that you take a deeper dive. Feel free to come to me to chat about anything that you find!

I'll be tracking AWS-related resources in this document that I have found useful. Let me know if you have any recommendations.
