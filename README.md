![AWS Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/AmazonWebservices_Logo.svg/2000px-AmazonWebservices_Logo.svg.png)

## Course Description

This course provides a practical, project-oriented introduction to cloud computing with [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/) (AWS). Students will learn how to build scalable, fault-tolerant and highly-available services using AWS, culminating in a resume-worthy final project that will be built, deployed and demoed.

## Course Details

- **Prerequisites**: C- or better in CMSC330 and CMSC351
- **Credits**: TBD
- **Seats**: 30
- **Lecture Time**: TBD (~50m, 1/week)
- **Semester**: *tentatively* Fall 2017
- **Textbook**: None
- **Lecturer/TA**: Colin King
- **Faculty Advisor**: TBD
- **Syllabus Last Updated**: April 12, 2017

## Topic List

The following are the proposed topics to be covered. This list should be considered tentative.

- Introduction to AWS
- Identity Access Management (IAM)
- Simple Storage Service (S3)
- CloudFormation
- CloudFront
- Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
- Simple Queue Service (SQS)
- Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
- DynamoDB 
	- Comparison with other AWS database products
- Lambda
- API Gateway
- Security

Learn more about these products [here](https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/products/).

## Computing Resources

Students will have access to AWS resources via the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/s/dm/optimization/server-side-test/free-tier/free_np/), which should be more than enough to cover all of the programming assignments in this course. Students may need to create a new AWS account if they have already used their credit.

Students may also receive access to further resources via [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/). More information will be released closer to the start of class.

## Schedule

| Week | Topic | Assignment |
| ---- | ----- | ---------- |
| TBD  | TBD   | TBD        |

## Projects

- Project 1: Dropbox Clone with S3 and CloudFront
- Project 2: TBD
- Project 3: TBD
- Project 4: TBD
- Project 5: TBD
- Project 6: TBD
- Final Project: See Below

Projects must be submitted electronically following the instructions given in each project assignment. Projects may not be submitted by any other means (e.g., please do not email your projects to us). It is your responsibility to test your program and verify that it works properly before submitting. All projects are due at 11:59 PM on the day indicated on the schedule above.

Projects may be submitted up to 24 hours late for a 10% penalty. If you submit both on-time & late, your project will receive the maximum of the penalty-adjusted scores.  You may submit multiple times.

Unlike lower-level programming classes, we will not provide you with test cases (e.g., public tests) before projects are due. You will be responsible for developing your own tests and for using appropriate testing techniques. Also, we expect your projects to use proper style and documentation.

## Grading

| % Total | Assignment           | Description |
| ------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| 60%     | Programming Projects | Biweekly individual projects that will involve designing and launching AWS services. |
| 20%     | Midterm              | The examination will focus on theoretical concepts. |
| 20%     | Final Project + Demo | A free-form final project that will be demoed to the class. |

Grades will be maintained on the CS department [grades server](https://grades.cs.umd.edu/).

You are responsible for all material discussed in lecture and posted on the class repository, including announcements, deadlines, policies, etc.

Any request for reconsideration of any grading on coursework must be submitted within **one week** of when it is returned. No requests will be considered afterwards.

*Completing the projects is an essential part of the course. Therefore, the course staff reserves the right to fail any student who does not make a good-faith attempt on all course projects.* The requirements for a good-faith attempt will be released with each project.

## Final Project

The final project will be an opportunity to apply all of the knowledge that you have gained into an application that you will build from the group up. The grading scheme for the final project is TBD, but it will factor in creativity and the number of AWS components used (3 minimum). Students are encouraged to incorporate other services that weren't covered in this course (such as AI, IoT, Mobile, etc.).

## Other Administrivia

### Course Staff Communications

Students can interact with the instructors in two ways: in-person during office hours and online via Piazza. Email should only be used for emergencies and not class related questions (e.g., projects).

### Excused Absence and Academic Accommodations
See the section titled "Attendance, Absences, or Missed Assignments" available at [Course Related Policies](http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html).

### Disability Support Accommodations

See the section titled "Accessibility" available at [Course Related Policies](http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html).

### Academic Integrity

Note that academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication, and plagiarism, but also includes helping other students commit acts of academic dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. In short, all submitted work must be your own. Cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued to the fullest extent possible as stipulated by the [Office of Student Conduct](http://osc.umd.edu/OSC/Default.aspx).

It is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating, fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the Code of Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit http://www.shc.umd.edu.

### Course Evaluations

If you have a suggestion for improving this class, don't hesitate to tell the instructor or TAs during the semester. At the end of the semester, please don't forget to provide your feedback using the campus-wide CourseEvalUM system. Your comments will help make this class better.
